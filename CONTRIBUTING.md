 - [Submission Guidelines](#submit)

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

* Join our Slack and ask us at #sparksystem channel
* Email: **tech@midburn.org**

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
submitting an issue to our GitHub repository. Even better you can submit a Pull Request
with a fix.

**Please see the [Submission Guidelines](#submit) below.**

## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub repository.  If you
would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on Slack
  channel or during the weekly meetup so that we can better coordinate our efforts,
  prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted
  into the project.
* **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the GitHub repository as a Pull
  Request.

### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize
the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.
Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with
quickly:

* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **Regression** - Is it a regression? Something worked before and now doesn't work?
* **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers or only specific ones?
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example (using [Plunker][plunker] or
  [JSFiddle][jsfiddle]) or an unambiguous set of steps.
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

Here is a great example of a well defined issue: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5069

**If you get help, help others. Good karma rulez!**

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

- Is the change important and ready enough to ask the community to spend time reviewing?
- Have you searched for existing, related issues and pull requests?
- Is this a new feature that can stand alone as an external component?
- Is the change being proposed clearly explained and motivated?

See: [Branching, patching and merging documentation](/docs/development/branching.md) for more details.

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
