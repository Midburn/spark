# Spark usage guide

This is the documentation hub for Spark usage.

It is intended for people wanting to use Spark or integrate with it.

**Note** If you just want to contribute to the development of Spark project, refer to the [Spark development guide](/docs/development/README.md).

## Personas and user stories

Spark is not ready for usage yet.

In the mean-time, have a look at our personas and user stories.

* [Personas (Google Doc)]() - Real or fictional people that we think will be interested in using Spark. Feel free to add yourself!
* [User stories (Google Doc)]() - How the personas will use our system. Feel free to add your own user stories and what features you would like us to implement.

## Integration guide

**TODO** Major part of Spark will be integration with 3rd parties and components. Here we will document how to implement those integrations.
